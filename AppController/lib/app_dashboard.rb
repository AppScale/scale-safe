# As we can't rely on DNS in AppScale, we have an app, called the
# AppDashboard, that provides a single place to route users to their
# applications. It also provides authentication for users as an
# implementation of the Google App Engine Users API. This module provides
# methods that abstract away its configuration and deployment.
