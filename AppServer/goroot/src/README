This is a modified version of the Google App Engine Go SDK that is used
within the AppScale project, which provides an open-source implementation
of the Google App Engine APIs. More info on AppScale can be found at:

http://appscale.cs.ucsb.edu

The source is all here to compile the Go SDK, but some prerequesite
programs must be installed first. Information on how to install that
software can be found here:

And as always, thanks for checking us out!
