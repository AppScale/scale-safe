This program requires the freetype-go and goauth2 libraries.

They should be checked out in this directory under these paths:

	freetype-go.googlecode.com
	goauth2.googlecode.com

This is so that these packages can be imported by Moustachio:

	"freetype-go.googlecode.com/hg/freetype/raster"
	"goauth2.googlecode.com/hg/oauth"

You can do this by running these commands:
	
	hg clone https://freetype-go.googlecode.com/hg \
		freetype-go.googlecode.com/hg

	hg clone https://goauth2.googlecode.com/hg \
		goauth2.googlecode.com/hg
